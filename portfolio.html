    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Dikshya Shakya. I am 20 years old and currently studying Bachelors in Information Management. 
        I am interested in web development and learning how to design and develop websites using HTML and CSS. 
        I enjoy working on small projects that help me understand how websites work and how users interact with them. 
        My goal is to improve my technical skills and become a professional web developer in the future.

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Project 1</h3>
    <p>
        This is my first project which focuses on building a simple static website using only HTML and CSS. 
        The main purpose of this project was to understand the basic structure of a web page and how different 
        HTML elements work together to create content. In this project, I created multiple sections such as 
        header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer. I learned how to use tags like div, header, 
        section, and footer to organize content properly.  

        This project also helped me understand how CSS can be used to style a website. I applied different 
        colors, fonts, and spacing to make the webpage visually appealing. I experimented with background colors, 
        padding, margins, and borders to improve layout. One of the major learning outcomes of this project was 
        understanding how CSS selectors work and how to apply styles to specific elements.  

        Another important aspect of this project was learning how to link pages together using anchor tags. 
        I created a small navigation menu that allows users to move between different sections of the website. 
        This improved my understanding of user experience and navigation design.  

        Overall, this project gave me confidence in writing HTML code and using CSS for basic design. It helped 
        me build a strong foundation in web development and motivated me to work on more complex projects in the future.
    </p>

    <h3>Project 2</h3>
    <p>
        This is my second project, which focused on creating a personal profile website. The goal of this project 
        was to design a webpage that represents an individual’s information such as name, education, skills, and 
        contact details. Through this project, I learned how to structure content in a clean and readable way.  

        I used different heading levels to organize the content properly and paragraph tags to display 
        information clearly. I also learned how to insert images and style them using CSS properties such as width, 
        height, and border-radius. This project taught me the importance of visual balance and alignment in a website.  

        I applied CSS styling techniques such as font styling, background colors, and box layout to improve the 
        appearance of the website. I also experimented with hover effects for links to make the site more interactive 
        for users. This project helped me understand how design choices affect user experience.  

        Another key learning point was making the website responsive by using percentage-based widths and flexible 
        layouts. This helped me understand how websites adapt to different screen sizes.  

        In conclusion, this project improved my ability to design a structured webpage and enhanced my creativity 
        in layout design. It also strengthened my understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to create complete web pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Project 3</h3>
    <p>
        This is my third project which involved building a simple project showcase website. The main objective 
        was to display multiple projects on a single webpage in an organized and user-friendly way. I created 
        separate sections for each project and added descriptions to explain their purpose and functionality.  

        This project helped me understand how to use CSS for layout management. I learned how to control spacing 
        between elements and how to use borders and background colors to separate content visually. I also learned 
        how to use lists and paragraphs effectively to present information neatly.  

        Another important lesson from this project was learning how to create a consistent design theme across the 
        website. I used similar fonts, colors, and spacing throughout the page to maintain uniformity. This helped 
        me understand the importance of consistency in web design.  

        I also learned about linking external files such as CSS stylesheets and organizing project files into 
        folders. This improved my understanding of project structure and file management.  

        Overall, this project improved my problem-solving skills and helped me apply theoretical knowledge in a 
        practical way. It encouraged me to focus on clarity, structure, and presentation in web development projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Project 4</h3>
    <p>
        This is my fourth project, which focused on creating a complete portfolio website. The aim of this project 
        was to combine all the skills I had learned from previous projects into one complete application. I designed 
        sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact Information.  

        Through this project, I learned how to use navigation menus to jump between sections of a webpage. I used 
        internal links to connect different parts of the website. This helped me understand how single-page websites 
        work and how users can easily access information.  

        I also applied advanced CSS concepts such as layout alignment, color contrast, and font styling to make the 
        website visually attractive. I learned how to create visually separated sections using background colors and 
        borders.  

        This project also helped me understand how to present information professionally. I learned how to write 
        clear project descriptions and arrange them logically. It also taught me the importance of simplicity and 
        readability in web design.  

        In conclusion, this project strengthened my confidence in web development and allowed me to create a 
        professional-looking website using only HTML and CSS. It represents my growth as a learner and my dedication 
        to improving my skills.
